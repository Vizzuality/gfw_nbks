A collection of Jupyter Notebooks to test, and support features of the Global Forest Watch platform.

### Important

When working on a widget, remember that each notebook contains functions and algorithms that depend upon those found in ```1.Globals_and_Metadata.ipynb``` so be sure to keep this in mind this when working on a widget!

The first notebook ```0.Importable_Globals.ipynb``` is a copy of ```1.Globals_and_Metadata.ipynb```...the only difference being that ```0.Importable_Globals.ipynb``` has no notes or outputs, so it can be run quicky at the beggining of each notebook.

### Requirements

Python > 3.5

For any system, we recommend obtaining Python from [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/python).

To obtain the packages required to run these notebooks simply:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`
